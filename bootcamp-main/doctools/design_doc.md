# kanan-hello Design Document

## Problem Statement

Developers need a simple, well-documented example package that demonstrates Python best practices including:
- Clean code principles
- Type annotations
- Rich console output
- Command-line interface development
- Package distribution

## Goals

1. Create a minimal but complete Python package that demonstrates best practices
2. Provide a reference implementation for:
   - Type annotations
   - Rich console formatting
   - CLI development with Typer
   - Package configuration with pyproject.toml
3. Serve as a learning tool for Python package development
4. Demonstrate proper documentation techniques

## Non-Goals

1. Provide complex functionality beyond simple greetings
2. Support Python versions below 3.8
3. Include web interfaces or APIs
4. Implement database integrations

## Design Options

### Option 1: Minimal Package (Selected)

A focused package with core greeting functionality, rich formatting, and a simple CLI.

**Pros:**
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Demonstrates key concepts without overwhelming complexity
- Quick to implement and document

**Cons:**
- Limited real-world utility
- May be too simple for advanced demonstrations

### Option 2: Extended Utility Package

A more comprehensive utility package with additional features like logging, configuration management, and more CLI commands.

**Pros:**
- More practical real-world utility
- Demonstrates more advanced concepts

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity makes it harder to understand
- Requires more development and maintenance time
- May obscure the core educational purpose

### Option 3: Interactive Tutorial Package

A package designed specifically as an interactive tutorial with step-by-step guides embedded in the code.

**Pros:**
- Maximizes educational value
- Provides guided learning experience

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation
- Mixes code and tutorial content
- Less representative of real-world packages

## Decision

We've selected Option 1 (Minimal Package) because it best balances educational value with simplicity. The package will focus on demonstrating core Python packaging concepts without unnecessary complexity.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Main Module (`main.py`)**
   - Provides `say_hello()` function for basic greetings
   - Implements `print_rich_hello()` for formatted output using Rich
   - Includes proper type annotations and docstrings

2. **CLI Module (`cli.py`)**
   - Implements Typer-based command-line interface
   - Provides `hello` and `simple` commands
   - Includes help text and argument handling

3. **Package Configuration**
   - Uses modern `pyproject.toml` for package metadata
   - Defines dependencies and entry points
   - Follows PEP 621 standards

### Dependencies

- **rich**: For formatted console output
- **typer**: For command-line interface
- **hatchling**: For build system

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| TestPyPI availability | Medium | Low | Document alternative installation methods |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Low | Specify compatible version ranges |
| Documentation clarity | High | Medium | Peer review documentation before publishing |
| Python version compatibility | Medium | Medium | Test on multiple Python versions |

## Future Enhancements

1. Add unit tests with pytest
2. Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Add more CLI commands and options
4. Create interactive examples
5. Add internationalization support
