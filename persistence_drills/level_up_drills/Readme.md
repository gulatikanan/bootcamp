# Advanced Database Engineering: Production-Ready Challenges

**Author: kanan**

A comprehensive collection of database challenges that mirror real-world engineering problems. These exercises emphasize practical decision-making, failure analysis, and production considerations for building resilient persistence systems.

**1. Schema Evolution and Migrations**

**Challenge:** You're working at a fast-growing startup where the initial `users` table design is no longer sufficient. The table currently has `id` and `name`, but you need to add a `created_at` timestamp to track user registration patterns.

* Design and execute a zero-downtime migration strategy
* Create rollback scripts in case of migration failure
* Implement data validation to ensure migration correctness

**Reflection:**
* What are the risks of locking a large table during migration?
* How would you handle this migration if the table had 10 million rows?

**2. Model Boundary Enforcement**

**Challenge:** Your API is returning inconsistent data structures, and database changes are breaking client applications. You need to establish clear boundaries between your data layer and API contracts.

* Build a user profile update endpoint with strict layer separation
* Ensure database models never escape the service layer
* Create transformation logic between internal models and API responses

**Reflection:**
* What security risks arise from exposing raw database objects?
* How do you handle complex nested data transformations efficiently?

**3. Idempotent Upserts (Insert or Update)**

**Challenge:** Your e-commerce platform receives product updates from multiple vendors simultaneously. You need to handle both new product creation and existing product updates without conflicts.

* Implement database-specific upsert operations
* Handle unique constraint violations gracefully
* Ensure operation idempotency across multiple calls

**Reflection:**
* Why is idempotency crucial for microservices communication?
* How do you test upsert behavior under high concurrency?

**4. Versioned Data Storage**

**Challenge:** Regulatory compliance requires maintaining a complete audit trail of user email address changes. You cannot simply overwrite existing data.

* Design an efficient versioning schema
* Implement time-travel queries for historical data access
* Consider storage optimization for frequently updated records

**Reflection:**
* What are the trade-offs between event sourcing and data versioning?
* How do you handle queries that span multiple versions?

**5. Concurrency and Race Condition Management**

**Challenge:** Your payment system is experiencing double-spending issues due to race conditions during money transfers between accounts.

* Reproduce the race condition with concurrent transactions
* Implement proper locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption
* Design retry logic for handling deadlocks

**Reflection:**
* What debugging techniques help identify concurrency issues?
* How do you balance data consistency with system performance?

**6. Handling Large Binary Data**

**Challenge:** Your social media platform needs to store user-uploaded images efficiently while maintaining fast access times and reasonable storage costs.

* Compare database BLOB storage vs. filesystem approach
* Implement proper cleanup for orphaned files
* Design a strategy for handling different image sizes and formats

**Reflection:**
* How do CDNs change your binary data storage decisions?
* What are the backup and disaster recovery implications of each approach?

**7. Schema-First vs Code-First Modeling**

**Challenge:** You're joining a team that already has a well-established database schema managed by DBAs. You need to create application models that work with this existing structure.

* Generate ORM models from existing database schema
* Handle naming convention mismatches between database and code
* Document the mapping between schema and application concepts

**Reflection:**
* When should database design drive application structure?
* How do you manage schema changes in a schema-first environment?

**8. Data Lifecycle Management**

**Challenge:** Your application needs to support "deleting" products while maintaining order history and supporting potential restoration.

* Implement soft delete functionality with proper filtering
* Create automated archival processes for old soft-deleted records
* Ensure all application queries respect deletion state

**Reflection:**
* What are the hidden costs of soft delete implementations?
* How do you prevent performance degradation from accumulating deleted records?

**9. Boundary Testing with Large Datasets**

**Challenge:** Your application performs well in development but struggles with production data volumes. You need to identify performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

* Generate realistic test datasets at production scale
* Measure and compare different data insertion strategies
* Identify memory and performance constraints

**Reflection:**
* How do you create meaningful performance benchmarks?
* What database maintenance becomes necessary at large scales?

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases
* Familiarity with an ORM framework (SQLAlchemy recommended)
* Access to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production-like testing

## Approach

Start with a working solution, then iterate to handle edge cases and optimize performance. Focus on understanding why each design choice matters in production environments.

## Success Indicators

* Your solution handles the specified requirements robustly
* You can explain the trade-offs of your implementation choices
* The code includes appropriate error handling and monitoring
* You've considered operational aspects like maintenance and scaling
